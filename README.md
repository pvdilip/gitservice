## How to Run 

This application is packaged as a jar which has Tomcat embedded. No Tomcat or JBoss installation is necessary. You run it using the ```java -jar``` command.

* Clone this repository 
* Make sure you are using JDK 1.8 and Maven 3.x
* You can build the project and run the tests by running ```mvn clean package```
* Once successfully built, you can run the service by one of these two methods:
```
        java -jar target/git-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
or
        mvn spring-boot:run 
```
